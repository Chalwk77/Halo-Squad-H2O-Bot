# Halo Squad | H2O BOT

## Description:
#### A simple (comical) gag bot that reminds users on a voice call to drink H2O.

> A timer will begin counting down from 5 minutes when a user connects to a voice channel.
At 2 minutes 30 seconds, the Bot will "nag" the member for a response, saying things like: "_Have you drunk your quota of H2O today?_" and "_Such moist, much thirst. Are you dehydrated?_"

> A member must reply to the bot with "_yes_" or "_no_".

> No response within 300 seconds (or responding with "_no_") results in being disconnected from the call.
Replying with "_yes_" saves you.

A Discord bot framework built using the Discordia API and Luvit runtime environment.
